# TESTING 
# target_type will be WALL
# replacement_type will be GROUND
# threshold should be tested with values from 1 to 10
# percent_positivity should be tested from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.2
# all tests should record how different the results are from the unprocessed color matrix
# those should be recorded to test_results/test_results.txt
# additionally an image should be saved for each test under test_results/images/ with a number that corresponds to entry in test_results.txt
